# BUS5001 Assignment 3 – Q4: Evaluating Cloud-Based Technology (NotebookLM)

## 4a. Extracting Citations for Assignments

While working on my report for BUS5001 – *Cloud Platforms and Analytics*, I needed to reference multiple academic sources using APA 7th edition format. Normally, manually formatting citations is tedious and prone to errors. To make the process easier, I used **NotebookLM’s “Discover sources” feature**.

### What I Did
- Clicked the **Discover** button in NotebookLM.
- Selected APA citation resources:
  - *APA 7th Edition Reference Guide*
  - *In-text Citations – APA Style*
  - *Victoria University APA Referencing Guide*
- Typed the prompt:  
  `"List all references or citations in APA format from this document."`
- NotebookLM automatically returned citations correctly formatted in APA style.

### Why It Was Helpful
- Saved time and reduced formatting errors.
- Ensured compliance with university citation standards.
- Avoided switching between external tools and lecture notes.
- Made referencing feel like an integrated part of my workflow.

## 4b. Pulling Insights from Multiple Sources

For exam prep and assignment writing, I needed to connect ideas from various weeks of lectures and workshop files. Instead of manually browsing each PDF, I tested NotebookLM’s ability to synthesise knowledge from multiple documents at once.

### What I Did
- Uploaded **15 documents**, including:
  - `BUS5001-Wk01.pdf`, `BUS5001-Wk04-Security.pdf`, `BUS5001-Wk09-AI-in-the-Cloud.pdf`, `BUS5001-Wk12.pdf`
  - Workshop materials and lecture slides
- Entered a high-level question:
  > "Compare ethical frameworks across cloud security, data governance, and AI regulations."
- NotebookLM processed all files and responded with integrated insights from:
  - Week 1: foundational knowledge
  - Week 4 & 12: cloud security and privacy
  - Week 9: AI ethics
  - APA citation guides

### Why It Was Helpful
- Helped connect interrelated topics from different weeks.
- Accelerated revision and gave me confidence in structuring my arguments.
- Provided context-rich responses that I could refine for assignments and exams.
- Eliminated the need to search multiple files manually.

## 4c. My Reflections on NotebookLM’s Capabilities

### i. Accuracy and Relevance

NotebookLM mostly delivers reliable summaries, especially from structured lecture slides. It clearly explained key concepts like *data privacy*, *PaaS*, and *governance*. However, vague or complex source documents sometimes led to slightly inaccurate or oversimplified responses. Overall, I found the output very useful but occasionally needed to double-check the details.

### ii. Usefulness for Students

From a student perspective, this tool is a game changer:
- No need to flip through dozens of PDFs to find what I need.
- I could ask natural language questions and get direct answers.
- The automatic citation feature alone saved me hours during assignment season.

### iii. Limitations and Concerns

While useful, there are a few things to watch out for:
- **Bias or outdated content** if old materials are used as sources.
- **Risk of over-reliance** – relying entirely on AI-generated summaries can cause key details to be missed.
- **Data privacy** – I was careful not to upload sensitive academic content, since the platform is hosted by Google.

## Final Thoughts

NotebookLM played a supportive role in my academic work for BUS5001. It helped me revise faster, manage citations more effectively, and navigate course material more easily. However, critical thinking and validation of AI responses were still essential. I now view NotebookLM as a smart assistant that augments—not replaces—my own analysis.
