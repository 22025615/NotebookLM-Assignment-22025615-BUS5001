## 4. Evaluating Cloud Based Technology

### a) Key Functionalities of NotebookLM (2 Marks)

NotebookLM offers several features that are highly aligned with academic use cases:

- **Document Upload & Analysis**: Users can upload PDFs, slides, lecture notes, and more, allowing the AI to read and respond based on that content.
- **Automatic Summarisation**: Generates clear summaries for long documents or notes.
- **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions about the uploaded materials and get accurate, context-based responses.
- **Citation Support**: Includes automatic citation generation in APA 7th style.
- **Multi-Source Insight Extraction**: Can pull context from multiple documents at once for deeper academic analysis.

These functions mirror the everyday activities of students and researchers — such as exam prep, literature review, summarising readings, and proper referencing.

### b) Demonstrating Use of NotebookLM in Academic Scenarios (5 Marks)

#### 4. Extracting Citations for Assignments

While working on my BUS5001 report, I used NotebookLM to quickly gather and format citations in APA 7th edition. This eliminated the need to manually search and format references.

**Steps Taken**:
- Used the **Discover** feature to find APA referencing guides.
- Added the following sources:
  - APA 7th Edition Reference Guide
  - In-text Citations – APA Style
  - Victoria University’s APA Referencing Web Guide
- Prompted:  
  `"List all references or citations in APA format from this document."`
- NotebookLM returned structured citations instantly.

**Why It Helped**:
- Avoided manual formatting errors.
- Saved time during assignment preparation.
- Made it easy to follow academic integrity standards.

#### 5. Pulling Insights from Multiple Sources

For exam prep, I tested how NotebookLM handles multiple lecture PDFs and notes at once.

**Steps Taken**:
- Uploaded 15 files:  
  _BUS5001-Wk01, Wk04, Wk09, Wk12, Workshop PDFs, Lecture Slides, etc._
- Asked a higher-order question:  
  `"Compare ethical frameworks across cloud security, governance, and AI."`
- NotebookLM analysed across weeks and summarised key takeaways from multiple files.

**Why It Helped**:
- Brought together connections between topics I hadn’t considered.
- Helped me revise faster.
- Provided structured responses I could re-use in my answers.

### c) Critical Analysis of NotebookLM’s Capabilities (3 Marks)

#### i. Accuracy and Relevance of AI Output

NotebookLM generally provides useful, accurate summaries and definitions — particularly when content is structured well (e.g., lecture slides or APA guides). However, vague or unstructured sources may lead to less precise answers. For example, definitions of "data governance" were consistent, but some deeper questions produced oversimplified responses.

#### ii. Usefulness in Academic Workflows

As a student, I found NotebookLM particularly valuable for:
- Summarising lecture content efficiently.
- Preparing revision notes.
- Automatically generating correct citations.
- Quickly checking my understanding through Q&A.

#### iii. Limitations and Concerns

- **Hallucinations**: Occasionally, it invents references or misinterprets ambiguous content.
- **Bias**: It reflects the bias in uploaded materials — outdated readings may lead to outdated answers.
- **Privacy**: Since it’s a cloud-based tool, sensitive documents (e.g., unpublished research) should be used with caution.

### Final Thoughts

NotebookLM is a helpful assistant for students and researchers. It’s not perfect and needs human oversight, but when used wisely, it saves significant time and improves academic productivity.
