   Generates clean and concise summaries from uploaded lecture notes, PDFs, or documents, allowing students to grasp key concepts quickly.

2. **Context-Aware Q&A**  
   Allows students to ask questions based on the content of uploaded files. The responses are tailored to the specific material, making it ideal for revision and clarification.

3. **Citation Extraction and Referencing Support**  
   NotebookLM can extract properly formatted citations (APA 7th edition) from academic content, helping students comply with referencing standards efficiently.

4. **Study Guide and Note Generation**  
   Automatically creates structured outlines or topic-wise guides from lecture notes, which helps in efficient exam preparation.

5. **Multi-Source Analysis**  
   Capable of synthesising and comparing content from multiple uploaded documents, allowing users to consolidate knowledge across topics and weeks.

## 4b) Demonstrating Features of NotebookLM in an Academic Scenario

### 1. Summarising Lecture Slides and Notes  
Uploaded lecture slides on cloud platforms and security. Using “Summarise this source,” NotebookLM returned concise overviews including:
- Layers of cloud security
- Identity and access control importance
- Threat mitigation strategies

**Why helpful:** It reduced reading time significantly and allowed me to focus on weak areas.

---

### 2. Asking Questions from Uploaded Notes  
I asked:
- “What is a cloud-native service?”
- “Compare IaaS vs PaaS.”

NotebookLM returned focused, accurate answers by referencing uploaded PDFs.

**Why helpful:** Felt like having a personal tutor ready 24/7 to clear doubts.

---

### 3. Automatically Creating Study Outlines  
I used the "Guide Me" or "Briefing Doc" feature after uploading week-wise PDFs.

The AI generated:
- Headings like Cloud Models, Cost Management, and Shared Responsibility
- Bullet points under each section, ready for flashcard prep

**Why helpful:** Provided a structured revision framework automatically.

---

### 4. Extracting Citations for Assignments  
Uploaded APA guides and BUS5001 resources, used “Discover Sources” and asked:
> “List all references or citations in APA format from this document.”

NotebookLM pulled all the references perfectly formatted.

**Why helpful:** Saved hours of referencing work and ensured APA compliance.

---

### 5. Pulling Insights from Multiple Sources  
Uploaded 15 lecture documents (Weeks 1–12, workshop PDFs, and slides). Asked:
> “Compare ethical frameworks across cloud security, governance, and AI.”

NotebookLM:
- Referenced Wk01 for foundational concepts
- Pulled ethics content from Wk09 AI
- Cited privacy and frameworks from Wk04 and Wk12

**Why helpful:** Brought together complex material across weeks into one cohesive summary.

## 4c) Critical Analysis of NotebookLM’s Capabilities

### i) Accuracy and Relevance  
- NotebookLM was mostly accurate when source material was clean and well-formatted.
- Sometimes vague when documents lacked structure.
- Summaries were generally useful, but I had to verify some points manually.

### ii) Usefulness in Academic Workflows  
- Helped with exam prep by centralising materials
- Follow-up Q&A clarified doubts quickly
- Citation extraction was a huge time-saver

### iii) Limitations and Concerns  
- **Hallucinations**: Occasionally guessed incorrect info from vague inputs.
- **Bias & Gaps**: Doesn’t update outdated references in older files.
- **Privacy**: Sensitive or unpublished university materials shouldn't be uploaded.

## Final Thoughts  
NotebookLM is a valuable learning assistant. It improved my study efficiency during BUS5001 by summarising, extracting citations, and consolidating knowledge. However, it should not replace critical thinking or proper revision. Best used as a smart support tool—not a replacement for learning.
