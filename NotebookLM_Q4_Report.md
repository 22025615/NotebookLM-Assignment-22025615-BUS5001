## Overview  
As part of this assessment, I explored Google’s NotebookLM — a note-based AI assistant — to understand how it could support academic workflows. I tested its ability to summarise notes, create citations, and draw insights from multiple sources. Below is a summary of what I did, what I found, and my reflections.

## 4. Extracting Citations for Assignments

When working on my BUS5001 report, I needed to reference several academic documents using APA 7th edition style. Normally, formatting citations manually is time-consuming. Instead, I used NotebookLM’s **“Discover sources”** feature.

### What I Did:
- Clicked the **Discover** button and selected APA-related documents such as:
  - *APA 7th Edition Reference Guide*
  - *In-text Citations – APA Style*
  - *Victoria University’s APA Referencing Web Guide*
- Then typed:  
  `"List all references or citations in APA format from this document."`
- NotebookLM automatically listed properly formatted citations.

### Why It Was Helpful:
- It saved me from manually formatting references.
- I didn’t have to switch between Google and lecture slides.
- Ensured I met academic standards easily.

## 5. Pulling Insights from Multiple Sources

For my exam prep, I needed to consolidate ideas from different weeks of lectures. So I tested NotebookLM’s ability to analyse multiple PDFs together.

### What I Did:
- Uploaded 15 documents:  
  *BUS5001-Wk01, Wk04, Wk09, Wk12, workshop files, slides, and readings*
- Asked a high-level question like:  
  `"Compare ethical frameworks across cloud security, governance, and AI."`
- NotebookLM responded by pulling info from Week 1, Week 9, and APA guides — giving me a well-rounded view.

### Why It Was Helpful:
- It connected topics I wouldn’t have thought to link myself.
- Helped revise quicker before tests.
- Gave me structured answers I could build on in my writing.

## 4c. My Reflections on NotebookLM’s Capabilities

### i. Accuracy and Relevance
NotebookLM generally gives decent, accurate summaries — especially when pulling from structured PDFs like slides. It helped explain things like “data privacy” and “platform as a service” quite well. But sometimes, when the source was unclear or vague, its output was also fuzzy. So I found it helpful — but not flawless.

### ii. Usefulness for Students
As a student, this tool saved me a lot of time:
- I didn’t need to open 10 tabs or scroll through long PDFs.
- I could ask follow-up questions to clarify doubts.
- Citation automation alone was worth it during assignment season.

### iii. Limitations or Risks
- **Over-Reliance**: It’s tempting to trust summaries without reading full texts.
- **Bias/Hallucination**: It sometimes gives oversimplified or outdated responses.
- **Data Privacy**: Uploading university material to a Google tool may raise concerns.

## Final Thoughts
NotebookLM is like having a helpful study buddy — one that won’t replace your thinking but makes study more efficient. As long as I double-check and stay critical, it supports my learning really well.
